<h3>What is LoanOrLeaseZ ?</h3>
LoanOrLeaseZ is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. LoanOrLeaseZ uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. 

LoanOrLeaseZ is a PoS-based cryptocurrency, and depend upon libsecp256k1 by sipa, the sources for which can be found here: https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1

LoanOrLeaseZ is a project which was created in January 2017, launched by a group of Masters graduated in Technology Institutes of Hardware, Web Programming and CryptoCurrency. Currently, the project has 60 Antminer L3 + devices. LoanOrLeaseZ was released to fund the development of the project, and using funds was a way to purchase new Antminer devices. The special issue is that we will pay LoanOrLeaseZ holders 50% of the profits from the mining of us every 45 days since LoanOrLeaseZ is listed on the exchange. On the other hand, our project is also interested in partners and is ready to collaborate by buying 30% LoanOrLeaseZ and allowing us to use their existing Antminer devices with low fee. Our mining plan at the beginning of the project was to mine the coins to be issued or newly listed, with low difficult and then we waited and sold out at high prices beyond expectations. Besides, when we find the coin that we see has the potential for growth or high price expectations we will also bring all our equipment to mine those coin. We are young with a dynamic creativity, willing to devote as much to the success and development of the company.
